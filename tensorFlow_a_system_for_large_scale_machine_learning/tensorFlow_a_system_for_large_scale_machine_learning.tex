\begin{abstract}
Because its predecessor, DistBelief, was too rigid for various types of ML work Large-scale training, small-scale service, and research are the three categories of ML work. DistBelief was fast for large-scale training, but if you want to scale down your training to run in a tiny environment with a small dataset or conduct research with new layers, you'll need to update the C++ code.

So Tensorflow \cite{abadi2016tensorflow} has Parameter servers are distributed key-value stores that keep track of the status of model parameters. Moreover, Workers read data from disk, execute mathematical computations, and update model parameters using parameter servers to drive the training process. These workers are usually powered by a high-performance CPU or GPU.

\section{Strong point of the document}

\subsection{Effectiveness of combining parameters communication and labour server utilization}
There is no differentiation between a parameter server process and a worker process in TensorFlow. The implementation is the same for all processes. A stateful or stateless process can exist. Stateful ones, which act like parameter servers, feature a mutable buffer to hold model parameters. Stateless individuals can concentrate on crunching numbers and communicating with stateful individuals to get and set those parameters, effectively acting as laborers.

\end{figure}
A tensor is a multi-dimensional array. Tensors flow along edges in a dataflow graph where vertices are operations.

\subsection{Multiple Language Backends for Graph Computation}
For efficiency, the TensorFlow runtime is written in C++. Python, Go, Java, C++, and other languages can be used for user-level code. Programmers create a graph, designate the node(s) for which they want a value (fetch), and supply input data. The following is what the TensorFlow runtime does with the graph.
\begin{enumerate}
\item Partial execution graph pruning: TensorFlow examines the graph and only performs the calculations required to compute the fetch.
\item A TensorFlow workflow can have several subgraphs running at the same time. Some subgraphs are run in parallel, such as concurrent preprocessing, which modifies incoming data independently. Concurrent subgraphs such as concurrent training, where parameters are changed based on various input batches, interact through shared variables and queues.
\item TensorFlow's runtime distributes actions across different devices. Computationally intensive operations are performed on GPUs by default, while stateful bookkeeping functions are placed on CPUs. Users have the ability to customize their own placement. The problem of determining the best device location automatically is still under investigation. On each edge that traverses devices, the TensorFlow runtime inserts a communication channel.
\end{enumerate}
\begin{figure}[htbp]

\end{figure}
\subsection{Dynamic Control Flow in TensorFlow}
Conditional and iterative control flows are used in several sophisticated machine learning methods (e.g., recurrent neural networks and reinforcement learning). The goal of dynamic control flow in a machine learning framework is to provide conditionals and loops through a TensorFlow interface (in-graph control flow). Programmers must rely on user-level language conditional and loop constructions in the absence of in-graph control flow (out-of-graph control flow). TensorFlow defines control-flow primitives (e.g. switch, merge, nextIteration) to express conditional and loop constructs. As a result, conditionals and loops can be represented graphically. In-graph control flow allows TensorFlow to process and optimize a single unified graph, thus allowing more parallelism and distribution.
