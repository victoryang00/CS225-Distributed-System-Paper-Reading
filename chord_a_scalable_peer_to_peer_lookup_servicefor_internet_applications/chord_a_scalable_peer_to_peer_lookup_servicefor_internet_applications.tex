%% article.
\begin{abstract}
Many problems in distributed systems can be attributed to the problem of obtaining global states, e.g. stable property detection, where a stable property is immutable, e.g., a computation has stopped or completed (which does not recover itself), a system deadlock (which does not recover itself), and through global states, these stable properties can be detected.
For a distributed system, we need to record the global state of the system at the same point in time, including the state of each process and the state of the associated channel (a computation is a graph consisting of a finite number of processes and channels composed graph). This is the problem that the distributed snapshot algorithm solves, because there is no global unified lock, so it is impossible to guarantee that all processes can record their state information at the same time.

\section{Strong point of the document}

\subsection{The paper introduced a Distributed System Model}
A distributed system contains a finite set of processes and a finite set of channels, which can be described by a directed graph (vertices represent processes, edges represent channels), as shown in the following figure.
